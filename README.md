# IrelandTrainTimes_ChromeExtension

This is a Chrome extension for Ireland Train Times. This can be found on the Chrome webstore here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ireland-train-times/bogogjpgigjncglhdnihmnepfdbjlkka?hl=en-GB


This was originally released around May 2014.

Note: This was my first JavaScript project, and I know it's badly written! I plan to re-write the extension in Angular sometime soon.

The code for this was stored in my Dropbox and in Google Code. I'm now moving this to Github.
